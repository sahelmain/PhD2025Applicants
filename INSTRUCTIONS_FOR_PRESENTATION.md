# How to Present Your PhD Applications Analysis

This guide will help you present the interactive analysis you've created to impress your professor for the RA position.

## Files to Show

1. **Interactive Dashboard**: `phd_applications_dashboard.html`
   - **This is your main presentation tool.**
   - Open this in a web browser. It contains all visualizations, which are now interactive (hover, zoom, pan).

2. **Key Insights**: `key_insights.md`
   - Contains concise bullet points of the main findings, derived from the interactive exploration.
   - Use this to structure your discussion of findings.

3. **Analysis Code**: `analyze_phd_applications.py`
   - Shows your technical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and using Plotly for interactive visualization.
   - Well-documented code demonstrates your methodical approach.

4. **Summary Statistics**: `summary_statistics.csv`
   - Contains numerical summary of key metrics.
   - Use to support your insights with concrete numbers.

*(Note: The `plots/` directory is no longer used as plots are embedded in the dashboard)*

## Presentation Steps

1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**
   - Briefly explain what you analyzed and why it's valuable.
   - Mention your methodical approach: data cleaning, exploration, *interactive* visualization, and insights.
   - Highlight that the main output is an interactive dashboard.

2. **Demo the Interactive Dashboard (7-8 minutes)**
   - Open `phd_applications_dashboard.html` in a browser.
   - **Spend most of your time here.** Give a guided tour.
   - **Actively demonstrate the interactivity**: Hover over bars/points, zoom into plots, show how tooltips provide details.
   - Walk through each section (Demographics, Academics, Test Scores, Relationships, Comparisons), explaining what each plot shows *and* how the interactivity enhances understanding.

3. **Highlight Key Findings (3-4 minutes)**
   - Transition from the dashboard demo to summarizing the main takeaways.
   - Use the `key_insights.md` file as a reference.
   - Connect findings directly back to what you demonstrated in the interactive dashboard (e.g., "As we saw when hovering over the GPA distribution...").

4. **Show Your Technical Approach (2 minutes)**
   - Briefly show the Python code (`analyze_phd_applications.py`).
   - Mention using `pandas` for data manipulation and `plotly` for creating the interactive plots embedded in the HTML.

5. **Discuss Future Directions (1-2 minutes)**
   - Suggest ways to enhance the *interactive dashboard* (e.g., adding filters, incorporating admission data).
   - Show you're thinking about how to make the tool even more useful.

6. **Q&A Preparation**
   - Be ready to navigate the dashboard to answer specific questions visually.
   - Know your summary statistics.
   - Be prepared to discuss limitations (e.g., missing data).

## Presentation Tips

1. **Practice with the Script**: Use `presentation_script.md` (updated version) to practice your delivery, focusing on the dashboard demo.

2. **Emphasize Interactivity**: Clearly demonstrate *how* the interactivity (hover, zoom) helps in exploring and understanding the data better than static plots.

3. **Know Your Audience**: Tailor your emphasis:
   - Data-focused: Highlight how interactivity reveals nuances (distributions, outliers).
   - Research-focused: Show how interactive exploration can answer specific recruitment questions.
   - Technically-focused: Mention using Plotly and embedding plots in HTML.

4. **Smooth Transitions**: Practice moving between explaining a concept and demonstrating it live on the interactive dashboard.

5. **End with Value**: Conclude by summarizing how this *interactive* analysis provides a powerful, modern tool for understanding the applicant pool.

This interactive approach is more engaging and showcases modern data visualization skills. Good luck!
